##TIME 2 SEIZURE PREDICTION MODEL
This project used data collected by Neuro Vista as part of the first implanted seziure likelihood study conducted 2010-2011. The dataset was stored on the cloud (IEEG.org) for this project, and was accessed through the used of a developed MATLAB tookbox avialable on the site. Many supporting functions and libraries were used in this project for ML applications, interacting with the cloud, and parallel proecessing. Broad overviews of these areas are provided at the bottom of this README. The majority of this will describe the algorithm used and explain the DEMO files provided for a new user that has access to this dataste. This project was published in 2015 as part of my Master's Thesis in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania.
